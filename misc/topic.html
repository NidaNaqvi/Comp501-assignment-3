<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>


	<h2><b>Importance:</b></h2>
<p align="justify">Doing something to stop the spread of fake news is important because it can have significant effects on our society. When people believe false or misleading information, it can affect their decisions and have a
	tremendous impact on society. Fake news can also lose people's trust in our trusted news outlets, making it more difficult for them to differentiate between reliable and unreliable sources of news. Fake news is
	critically important as it can be intentionally used to sway public opinion on critical matters, such as elections, public policy, or social issues. This can harm the democratic process because people are swayed by
	false and misleading information, and they are unable to make informed judgments based on factual and reliable information. Overall, it is crucial to prevent the spread of fake news, as it is a fundamental building block for our
	society to make informed judgments based on factual and reliable information.</p>
	
	<h2><b>Relevance:</b></h2>
<p align="justify">Technology is progressively taking over peopleâ€™s lives, with everyone having a mobile phone or a computer. Even schooling nowadays prefers technology over pen and  paper.In addition to that, since technology has such
	an influence on our lives,social media and television can make one believe in fake stories. There is fabricated information that the news media illustrates that makes people have different opinions on.</p>
	
	<h2><b>Why we chose the topic:</b></h2>
	<p align="justify">We specifically chose the topic of fake news because of its relevance in today's media landscape, especially with the widespread consumption of news through social media. 
The aim is to highlight the impacts of fake news on society and the potential consequences for political parties, as false information can lead to biased perspectives and misunderstandings.</p>
