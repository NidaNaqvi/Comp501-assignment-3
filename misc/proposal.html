		<td> <em>The topic of fake news is chosen due to its relevance in today's media landscape, particularly with the rise of social media as a primary 
			source of news. Developing skills to discern between real and fake news is crucial for students' research and academic writing. The goal is to emphasize 
			the societal impacts of fake news and its potential consequences for political parties, as it can lead to biased perspectives and misunderstandings. Social media platforms 
			have become breeding grounds for fake news, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. The lack of stringent verification processes enables the rapid spread 
			of false or misleading information, shaping public opinion. Algorithms and personalized content delivery systems contribute to filter bubbles, reinforcing 
			users' existing beliefs and limiting exposure to dissenting views. This results in echo chambers where like-minded individuals dominate, stifling alternative ideas. 
			Social media's emphasis on engagement incentivizes the dissemination of sensationalized or emotionally charged content, exacerbating the spread of fake news. These 
			factors collectively polarize public opinion, strengthen biases, and undermine a shared understanding of reality. To combat these negative effects, users must 
			actively seek diverse perspectives and rely on reliable sources of information.</em></td>
