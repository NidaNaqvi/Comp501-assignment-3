	<h1><b>Fake news, filter bubbles and echo chambers</b></h1>

</ul><p align="justify">Fake news, filter bubbles and echo chambers are important issues in society that need to be addressed in order to build a more informed, understanding, and democratic society.
	Fake News is information that is false or misleading but is presented as facts or actual news. It can affect people's health, safety, and well-being as well as peoples trust in reputable news outlets,
	leading to inaccurate information of what's true and false. Filter bubbles and echo chambers are a phenomena in which people are exposed to specific information that validates their established opinion,
	resulting in division, radicalisation, and intolerance between opposing viewpoints. Social media sites have become hotbeds for fake news, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. The absence of strict verification
	processes allows false or misleading information to spread quickly among users, influencing public opinion. 
	Algorithms and personalized content delivery systems create filter bubbles, exposing users to content that reinforces their beliefs and filtering out dissenting views. This results in echo chambers where like-minded 
	individuals dominate and alternative ideas are scarce. Social media platforms prioritize engagement, incentivizing the spread of sensationalized or emotionally charged content, further amplifying fake news. This combination 
	of factors polarizes public opinion, strengthens biases, and undermines the shared understanding of reality. Users must actively seek diverse perspectives and reliable sources of information to counteract these negative effects.</p>
